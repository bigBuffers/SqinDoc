I have been through this problem multiple times and it has been a different issue each time. One of the following issues could have caused your problem and you could use the command line interface by using Ctrl+Alt+F1 (Replace F1 with F2,F3.... if your tty1 is occupied) to try the following solutions

NVIDIA drivers missing or broken?
Run nvidia-smi to access the NVIDIA system management interface. The output should be something of this sort.

If you're not able to access it, there is probably some issue with your graphic drivers.

In that case, you should be able to find out the name of your graphics card using lspci | grep VGA.
You can find out the compatible drivers for your graphics card using the link.
(Try without this stepand maybe then with this step if there was no success). Remove the existing broken drivers using sudo apt-get purge nvidia*.
Install the drivers using

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install nvidia-390 (Or whatever the compatible driver is for your graphics card)

Try a restart using systemctl reboot -i and hope your login loop is fixed.

Is your HOME your HOME?
Check the owner of your home directory using ls -l /home
If you don not own your home directory, change it using sudo chown $USER:$USER $HOME
Try a restart using systemctl reboot -i and hope your login loop is fixed.
Do you own your .Xauthority?
Check the owner of your home directory using ls -l ~/.Xauthority
If you don't own your .Xauthority, change it using sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.Xauthority
If you do, move your .Xauthority file using sudo mv ~/.Xauthority ~/.Xauthority.bak
Try a restart using systemctl reboot -i and hope your login loop is fixed.
You might need to do the same thing on .ICEauthority.
Is your /tmp right?
Run ls -ld /tmp and make sure the permissions are exactly drwxrwxrwt. The output should be of this sort
drwxrwxrwt 27 root root 36864 Sep 17 17:15 /tmp

If not, run sudo chmod a+wt /tmp
Try a restart using systemctl reboot -i and hope your login loop is fixed.
Maybe lightdm is your problem?
Reconfigure your display manager using dpkg-reconfigure lightdm and try out other display managers (gdm3,lightdm,) that are available. Maybe this will you give you enough clues to move forward.
If none of them help,try installing sddm using sudo apt-get install sddm
for one final try. reconfigure display to sddm.
If none of the above solutions worked, you can try re-installing ubuntu.

P.S: This is a compilation of answers from the sources I refered to, some from this post as well.
